  {
    prompt: "What caused disease?",
    answer: "Miasma — bad air — and God's punishment for sin. Not microbes. Germ theory is six centuries away. When the army outside Tunis collapsed to dysentery in 1270, medieval clergy explained it as God's verdict on the soldiers' sinfulness. Your character lives inside that explanation, not ours."
  },
  {
    prompt: "What was Jerusalem, cosmologically?",
    answer: "Medieval world maps placed Jerusalem at the literal center of the earth — the hinge where heaven and earth were closest. It was not a symbol of something sacred. It was the most real place in the universe. Fighting for it was not metaphor. This is not like any geography we carry in our heads."
  },
  {
    prompt: "What happened when a Crusader received the Eucharist?",
    answer: "The bread and wine literally, physically became Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation was empirically real to medieval Christians — as solid as gravity is to us. An army that had just received communion before a battle understood itself to be carrying God in its body. That changes how you fight."
  },
  {
    prompt: "What was a relic?",
    answer: "A working technology. A piece of the True Cross or a saint's bone was believed to radiate divine power — healing the sick, turning aside armies, guaranteeing victory. Armies carried relics into battle for exactly this reason. The Sainte-Chapelle in Paris was built specifically to house them. These were not folk superstitions; they were the consensus of the most educated people in Europe."
  },
  {
    prompt: "Did Muslims and Christians see this as a 'clash of civilizations'?",
    answer: "No — that framing is largely modern. Many Islamic chroniclers initially found the Crusaders barbaric and poorly educated, but were also genuinely curious about them. Ibn Jubayr and Usama ibn Munqidh wrote accounts that mix contempt with observation. Saladin and Frederick II corresponded. Al-Kamil offered Jerusalem back diplomatically. The boundaries were far more porous and complicated than the 'total holy war' story suggests."
